**Abstract**

Traditional Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technologies have made significant strides in enhancing data accessibility for non-technical users. However, in many practical application scenarios, users still need to recall or guess table names, field names, or their synonyms, leading to inefficient querying and a suboptimal user experience. This paper proposes a "Search-driven NL2SQL" paradigm. Its core idea is to leverage the powerful symbolic pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a meticulously designed System Prompt. This guides the LLM to first infer relevant fields based on the specific data values or data patterns input by the user, and then further deduce the corresponding tables, ultimately generating an SQL query. This method significantly lowers the cognitive barrier for users constructing queries. Users only need to provide the values, text snippets, or patterns they are interested in to achieve efficient and intelligent searching of the database. This paper will elaborate on the system design and working principles of Search-driven NL2SQL, and provide in-depth analysis through 8 practical user cases. Furthermore, this paper will demonstrate, using a professional evaluation dataset, the significant improvement in query efficiency of Search-driven NL2SQL across various query types compared to ordinary NL2SQL (both using GPT-4o as the underlying LLM). Experimental results show that the Search-driven NL2SQL paradigm can substantially enhance user query efficiency, offering new avenues for next-generation data interaction.

## 1. Introduction

With the deepening development of the data era, enabling non-SQL-savvy users to conveniently and efficiently extract insights from massive datasets has become a crucial topic in human-computer interaction. Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology emerged to automatically convert users' natural language questions into executable SQL queries. Although existing NL2SQL models have made significant progress in semantic understanding and SQL generation, users often face the following challenges in practical applications:
*   **High Cognitive Load**: Users need a certain understanding of the database schema, including table names, field names, and their meanings, or at least their synonyms.
*   **Low Query Efficiency**: To make the system accurately understand their intent, users often need to input lengthy and precise natural language descriptions, which reduces interaction efficiency.
*   **Insufficient Fault Tolerance**: Minor variations in user input phrasing or inaccuracies in recalling table/field names can lead to query failures or incorrect results.

Addressing these issues, particularly the pain point that "users still need to mention synonyms of fields and tables in their queries, leading to low efficiency," this paper draws inspiration from the core concept of search engines—"reaching information directly through keywords"—and combines it with the exceptional capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in In-Context Learning and pattern recognition to propose a **Search-driven NL2SQL** method. Its core idea is: **Users provide data clues, and the LLM handles the reasoning chain.** That is, users only need to input the specific data values or data features they are interested in (e.g., "13812345678", "Shanghai >500", "yesterday"), and the system can intelligently back-infer the likely corresponding fields and tables, then generate the SQL query. If multiple interpretations are possible, the system presents options to the user, guiding them to complete the query.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
1.  Proposing and elaborating on the core concept, system architecture, and workflow of "Search-driven NL2SQL."
2.  Designing a system prompt optimized for Search-driven NL2SQL, with comprehensive examples.
3.  Providing a comprehensive, profound, and detailed analysis of the reasoning process and advantages of Search-driven NL2SQL through 8 carefully selected practical user cases.
4.  Conducting a multi-dimensional comparison of query efficiency between Search-driven NL2SQL and ordinary NL2SQL on a professional evaluation dataset, using GPT-4o as the LLM, and demonstrating the superiority of the new paradigm with comprehensive data.

## 2. Search-driven NL2SQL Methodology

The core of Search-driven NL2SQL lies in shifting the paradigm of user-database interaction: from "describing intent" to "providing clues." This relies on the LLM's powerful capabilities in contextual understanding, pattern matching, and logical reasoning.

### 2.1 System Prompt Design

The System Prompt is key to guiding the LLM to operate according to the search-driven logic. It needs to clearly define the LLM's role, task, core instructions, available tools, and necessary contextual information (such as database schema and sample data).

```sql
Today is June 6, 2025.
You are an AI Data Assistant. Please query the database according to the situation to answer user questions.
Your core task is to understand the user's query intent based on the "data clues" they provide.
You MUST follow this reasoning path:
1.  Analyze the "appearance" (format, type, common meaning) of each data fragment in the user's input.
2.  Based on the "appearance" of these data fragments, combined with the [Table Structure and Sample Data] provided below, back-infer the most likely corresponding database fields.
3.  Based on the back-inferred fields, further determine which data table(s) these fields belong to.
4.  If the user input contains multiple data fragments, consider them comprehensively; they are likely to belong to the same table or to tables related by common logic.
5.  If the user input contains comparison operators (e.g., >, <, >=, <=, !=, BETWEEN, LIKE) or logical operators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT), please reflect them correctly in the SQL.
6.  For vague date-related expressions (e.g., "yesterday," "last week," "last year"), please convert them accurately based on "today's" date.
7.  If, based on the user's data clues, more than one SQL query can be reasonably inferred (e.g., a number could correspond to price or stock, or a name could exist in both the customer table and the customer name field of the order table), you MUST generate a clear question listing all possible options (e.g., Option 1: Query products with price X; Option 2: Query products with stock X). Do NOT execute any SQL until the user makes a choice.
8.  The ultimate goal is to generate one, or (after user selection) one, accurate SQL query statement.

[Database Query Tool]
SQL Code Interpreter: Input parameter is an SQL query string. When a database query needs to be executed, output a JSON code block specifying the tool name as "sql_interpreter" and the SQL query to be executed.
For example:
{
  "tool_name": "sql_interpreter",
  "sql_query": "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_price > 100;"
}

[Table Structure and Sample Data]
Please carefully study the following table structures and sample data. They are your key basis for "data back-inference to fields, fields back-inference to tables":

Table Name: Products
product_id: p-985 (Product ID)
product_name: QB826G Power Bank (Product Name)
product_price: 200 (Product Unit Price)
product_stock: 100 (Product Stock)
product_launch_data: 2025-06-03 10:00:00 (Product Launch Date)

Table Name: Customers
customer_id: c-99 (Customer ID)
customer_name: Li Si (Customer Name)
customer_phone: 13812345678 (Customer Phone)
customer_address: No. 2, YY Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China (Customer Address)
customer_registration_date: 2025-06-02 10:00:00 (Customer Registration Date)

Table Name: Orders
order_id: o-8848 (Order ID)
customer_id: c-66 (Customer ID)
customer_name: Zhang San (Customer Name)
order_amount: 400 (Order Amount)
order_address: No. 1, XX Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China (Order Address)
order_creation_date: 2025-06-01 10:00:00 (Order Creation Date)
```

### 2.2 Reasoning Process

The reasoning process of Search-driven NL2SQL can be summarized as:
1.  **Data Pattern Recognition**: The LLM first analyzes the user's input string, identifying data fragments and their potential types (e.g., numbers, dates, phone numbers, address snippets, names).
2.  **Field Back-inference**: Combining the table structure and sample data from the System Prompt, the LLM matches the identified data fragments with the types, meanings, and sample values of fields in each table. For example, "13812345678" likely corresponds to the `customer_phone` field; "200.00" might correspond to `product_price` or `order_amount`.
3.  **Table Back-inference**: Based on the matched fields, the LLM infers the tables these fields belong to. If all inferred fields belong to the same table, the target table for the query is largely determined. If fields are spread across different tables, a JOIN operation or offering options might be necessary.
4.  **Operator and Logic Construction**: The LLM parses the relationships between data fragments and any potential implicit operators. For example, if a user inputs "Shanghai >500", the LLM understands it as the address containing "Shanghai" AND some amount field being greater than 500.
5.  **SQL Generation and Ambiguity Handling**: Based on the above inferences, the LLM generates an SQL query. If multiple reasonable interpretations exist (e.g., "500" could refer to product price or order amount), it presents options to the user as instructed by the System Prompt.
6.  **Relative Time Processing**: "Yesterday" will be converted to a specific date range (e.g., `BETWEEN '2025-06-05 00:00:00' AND '2025-06-05 23:59:59'`) based on "Today is June 6, 2025" from the System Prompt.

## 3. Detailed Case Studies

To demonstrate the superiority of the Search-driven NL2SQL solution, we list 8 practical user cases and analyze them comprehensively, profoundly, and in detail.

**General Premise**:
*   LLM: GPT-4o
*   System Prompt: The prompt defined in section 2.1.
*   Phone numbers are often input via copy-paste and are counted as 4 characters for efficiency calculation, representing a minimal input unit (actual length is 11, but this convention highlights user input simplicity). Other text and numbers are counted by their actual character length.

### 3.1 Case 1: Querying Customer Information by Specific Phone Number

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check, in the customer information table, all relevant information for the customer whose phone number is 15690374821` (37 characters, assuming Chinese characters are 1 char each for this count, or a direct translation of 89 English chars for "Please help me find all related information for the customer in the Customers table with the phone number 15690374821"). *For consistency with the original paper's character count logic, we'll use the provided Chinese character counts as a proxy for input effort.* (37 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_phone = '15690374821';
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `15690374821` (4 characters, efficiency improvement `(37-4)/4 * 100% = 825.00%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: The input "15690374821" is an 11-digit string, consistent with the common format of mainland China mobile phone numbers.
    *   **Field Back-inference**: The LLM checks against [Table Structure and Sample Data]:
        *   `Products` table: No obvious matching field.
        *   `Customers` table: The `customer_phone` field is VARCHAR, with a sample "13812345678", highly matching the input pattern.
        *   `Orders` table: No direct matching phone number field.
        *   Therefore, the LLM infers with high confidence that "15690374821" corresponds to `Customers.customer_phone`.
    *   **Table Back-inference**: The `customer_phone` field belongs to the `Customers` table.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**: The user directly provided a value, implying an exact match (`=`). Users typically expect "all relevant information," corresponding to `SELECT *`.
    *   **SQL Generation**: Based on these inferences, `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_phone = '15690374821'` is generated. Since the inference is unique and highly confident, no user choice is needed.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Utmost Conciseness**: The user only needs to input the core data "15690374821", without any redundant descriptions, table names, or field names.
    *   **Low Cognitive Cost**: The user doesn't need to remember that the "customer information table" is named `Customers`, nor that the phone field is `customer_phone`.
    *   **Significant Efficiency Boost**: Input characters drop from 37 to 4, drastically improving interaction speed, especially for high-frequency, exact-value query scenarios.
    *   **Robustness**: Avoids potential misunderstanding errors caused by inaccurate user descriptions of table/field names (e.g., "shopper table," "contact info").

### 3.2 Case 2: Querying Customer Information for Multiple Specific Phone Numbers

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check, in our customer data, all information for customers whose contact phone numbers are 15690374821 or 13826548392` (42 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_phone IN ('15690374821', '13826548392');
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `15690374821 13826548392` (9 characters: two 4-char phone numbers + 1 space. Efficiency improvement `(42-9)/9 * 100% = 366.67%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: The input contains two 11-digit strings "15690374821" and "13826548392", both matching the mobile number pattern, separated by a space.
    *   **Field Back-inference**: Similar to Case 1, both values are highly confidently inferred to correspond to `Customers.customer_phone`.
    *   **Table Back-inference**: The `customer_phone` field belongs to the `Customers` table.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**: Multiple similar values separated by a space, guided by the System Prompt hint ("space or comma separation implies 'IN' list, etc."), lead the LLM to infer the user's intent is to query customer information for either phone number, thus using the `IN` operator. `SELECT *` is assumed for "all information."
    *   **SQL Generation**: `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_phone IN ('15690374821', '13826548392')` is generated. The inference is unique and highly confident.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Input Remains Concise**: For multi-value queries, users simply list the data, separated by a common delimiter.
    *   **Intelligent Inference of Logical Relationships**: The LLM can automatically select appropriate SQL operators (like `IN` instead of multiple `OR`s) based on the juxtaposition of values and System Prompt guidance.
    *   **Good Scalability**: The input method remains concise even if the user inputs more phone numbers.

### 3.3 Case 3: Querying Orders by Specific Customer Name and Order Amount

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check the order records, I want to find the detailed information of orders where the customer name is Li Hua and the order amount is exactly 500 yuan` (50 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_name = 'Li Hua' AND order_amount = 500;
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `Li Hua 500` (6 characters: "Li Hua" 2, space 1, "500" 3. Efficiency improvement `(50-6)/6 * 100% = 733.33%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: The input contains the text "Li Hua" and the number "500".
    *   **Field Back-inference**:
        *   "Li Hua":
            *   `Customers.customer_name` (Customer Name, sample: Li Si) - Possible match.
            *   `Orders.customer_name` (Customer Name, sample: Zhang San) - Possible match.
        *   "500" (or 500.00):
            *   `Products.product_price` (Product Unit Price, sample: 200.00) - Possible match.
            *   `Orders.order_amount` (Order Amount, sample: 400.00) - Possible match.
    *   **Table Back-inference and Ambiguity Handling**:
        *   Combination 1: `Customers.customer_name` and `Products.product_price`. These fields are in different tables with no direct strong link unless a more complex query is implied, which usually requires clearer phrasing.
        *   Combination 2: `Customers.customer_name` and `Orders.order_amount`. Also in different tables, but `Orders` has `customer_id` which can link to `Customers`.
        *   Combination 3: `Orders.customer_name` and `Orders.order_amount`. Both fields are in the `Orders` table, making this the most direct and concise interpretation. The LLM prioritizes intra-table field combinations.
        *   The LLM, guided by the core instruction to prefer the simplest explanation, assumes "Li Hua" is `Orders.customer_name` and "500" is `Orders.order_amount`.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**: Two different types of values appearing together usually imply an `AND` logical relationship. The number "500" implies exact equality. "Detailed information" corresponds to `SELECT *`.
    *   **SQL Generation**: `SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_name = 'Li Hua' AND order_amount = 500` is generated with high confidence.
        *   *Alternative Ambiguity Handling*: If the System Prompt mandated stricter ambiguity handling, or if the LLM's confidence for this scenario were low, it might ask: "Do you mean: 1. Orders where customer name is Li Hua and order amount is 500? 2. Customer named Li Hua, and you want to query product information with a unit price of 500?" However, in this case, since the `Orders` table contains both customer name and order amount, querying the `Orders` table directly is most natural.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Natural Multi-condition Input**: Users simply list different types of data clues side-by-side.
    *   **Intelligent Association**: The LLM can intelligently associate different types of data fragments with the most likely single table and infer their logical relationship (usually AND).
    *   **Reduced User Cognitive Load**: Users don't need to explicitly state whether "Li Hua" is the customer name on the order or the customer name in the customer table; the LLM chooses the most direct path.

### 3.4 Case 4: Querying Orders by Specific Customer Name and Order Amount Range (Less Than)

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check the order records, I want to find the detailed information of orders where the customer name is Li Hua and the order amount is less than 500 yuan` (49 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_name = 'Li Hua' AND order_amount < 500;
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `Li Hua <500` (7 characters. Efficiency improvement `(49-7)/7 * 100% = 600.00%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: Input contains text "Li Hua" and a number with a comparison operator "<500".
    *   **Field Back-inference**: Same as Case 3, "Li Hua" is preferentially linked to `Orders.customer_name`, and "500" to `Orders.order_amount`.
    *   **Table Back-inference**: Fields point to the `Orders` table.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**: The explicit `<` operator indicates the filter condition for `order_amount` is less than 500. An `AND` logic connects "Li Hua" and "<500".
    *   **SQL Generation**: `SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_name = 'Li Hua' AND order_amount < 500` is generated.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Operator Support**: Users can directly use common mathematical comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, !=) to express more complex conditions, with input remaining concise.
    *   **Intuitive**: The "<500" expression is very natural and aligns with common shorthand habits.

### 3.5 Case 5: Querying Orders by Specific Address Keyword and Order Amount Range (Greater Than)

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check, in all order information, order records where the shipping address field contains the word Shanghai, and the actual payment amount for these orders is greater than 500 yuan` (64 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_address LIKE '%Shanghai%' AND order_amount > 500;
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `Shanghai >500` (7 characters. Efficiency improvement `(64-7)/7 * 100% = 814.29%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: Input contains text "Shanghai" and a number with a comparison operator ">500".
    *   **Field Back-inference**:
        *   "Shanghai": This is a place name fragment. Checking table structures:
            *   `Customers.customer_address` (sample: No. 2, YY Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China) - Possible match.
            *   `Orders.order_address` (sample: No. 1, XX Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China) - Possible match.
        *   ">500":
            *   `Products.product_price` - Possible match.
            *   `Orders.order_amount` - Possible match.
    *   **Table Back-inference and Ambiguity Handling**: Similar to Case 3, the LLM will prioritize the table that can accommodate both inferred conditions. The `Orders` table has `order_address` and `order_amount`, making it the most natural match.
        *   "Shanghai" is inferred to correspond to `Orders.order_address`, and since it's a text fragment, it usually implies a fuzzy match like `LIKE '%Shanghai%'`.
        *   ">500" is inferred to correspond to `Orders.order_amount > 500`.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**: An `AND` logic connects the two conditions.
    *   **SQL Generation**: `SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_address LIKE '%Shanghai%' AND order_amount > 500` is generated.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Intelligent Fuzzy Match Inference**: When a user inputs a place name fragment like "Shanghai," the LLM can intelligently infer it should apply to an address-type field and use `LIKE` for fuzzy matching, without the user needing to specify "contains," "includes," etc.
    *   **Concise Combined Conditions**: Even for a combination of text fuzzy matching and numerical range conditions, the input remains extremely brief.

### 3.6 Case 6: Querying Orders by Specific Address Keyword and Order Amount Range (Between)

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check, in the order table, all complete records of orders where the shipping address contains the city Shanghai, and the total amount of these orders is between 500 yuan and 1000 yuan` (64 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_address LIKE '%Shanghai%' AND order_amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `Shanghai 500-1000` (11 characters. Efficiency improvement `(64-11)/11 * 100% = 481.82%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: Input contains text "Shanghai" and a numerical range pattern "500-1000".
    *   **Field Back-inference**:
        *   "Shanghai" is preferentially linked to `Orders.order_address` (LIKE '%Shanghai%').
        *   "500-1000" is a common way to represent a numerical range. The LLM, comparing with numerical fields, preferentially links it to `Orders.order_amount`.
    *   **Table Back-inference**: Fields point to the `Orders` table.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**: The numerical range "X-Y" is intelligently parsed as `BETWEEN X AND Y` by the LLM, guided by the System Prompt hint ("'-' indicates a range"). It's connected to the "Shanghai" condition with `AND`.
    *   **SQL Generation**: `SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_address LIKE '%Shanghai%' AND order_amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000` is generated.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Intuitive Range Expression**: Users can naturally express numerical ranges using "500-1000", and the LLM automatically converts it to a `BETWEEN` clause.
    *   **Low Learning Curve**: This shorthand is commonly used in daily life, requiring almost no learning of new expression methods from the user.

### 3.7 Case 7: Querying Product Information by Specific Product Name Keyword and Relative Date (Yesterday)

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `Please help me check the product inventory, see if there are any products whose name field contains the words 'phone case', and whose launch time was within yesterday` (58 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output** (assuming today is 2025-06-06):
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Products 
    WHERE product_name LIKE '%phone case%' 
      AND product_launch_data BETWEEN '2025-06-05 00:00:00' AND '2025-06-05 23:59:59';
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `phone case yesterday` (6 characters, assuming "phone case" as 2, "yesterday" as 2, plus spaces. Let's be more precise based on English: "phone case" (10) + " " (1) + "yesterday" (9) = 20 chars. The original Chinese was 手机壳 (3) + 昨天 (2) + space (1) = 6. To keep the spirit of efficiency: `phonecase yesterday` could be `10+9 = 19` or a more abstract `keyphrase + relative_date` -> 2 units + 1 unit = 3 "semantic units". We'll use the original paper's "6 characters" as an effort proxy). (6 "effort units". Efficiency improvement `(58-6)/6 * 100% = 866.67%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: Input contains text "phone case" and the relative date keyword "yesterday".
    *   **Field Back-inference**:
        *   "phone case": This is a product name fragment. Checking table structures, it preferentially links to `Products.product_name` (sample: QB826G Power Bank). Implies `LIKE '%phone case%'`.
        *   "yesterday": This is a relative date expression. Checking table structures for datetime fields:
            *   `Products.product_launch_data` (Product Launch Date)
            *   `Customers.customer_registration_date` (Customer Registration Date)
            *   `Orders.order_creation_date` (Order Creation Date)
    *   **Table Back-inference and Ambiguity Handling**:
        *   "phone case" points to the `product_name` field in the `Products` table.
        *   "yesterday" needs to be associated with a date field. Since "phone case" has already limited the context to the `Products` table, the LLM will preferentially associate "yesterday" with the datetime field `product_launch_date` within the `Products` table.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**:
        *   "yesterday": The System Prompt states "Today is June 6, 2025". The LLM parses "yesterday" as June 5, 2025. For a datetime field, querying an entire day usually means `product_launch_date BETWEEN '2025-06-05 00:00:00' AND '2025-06-05 23:59:59'`.
        *   An `AND` logic connects the two conditions.
    *   **SQL Generation**: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_name LIKE '%phone case%' AND product_launch_data BETWEEN '2025-06-05 00:00:00' AND '2025-06-05 23:59:59'` is generated.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Relative Date Understanding**: The system can accurately parse relative time expressions like "yesterday," "last week," "tomorrow" by combining them with the current date context, converting them to absolute date ranges.
    *   **Context-constrained Field Inference**: When one data fragment (like "phone case") strongly suggests a particular table, another ambiguous data fragment (like "yesterday," which could apply to date fields in multiple tables) will be preferentially associated with a field of the corresponding type within the already implied table.
    *   **Extremely High Efficiency**: For queries involving dates, which are common but can be lengthy to express, search-driven input offers a massive efficiency improvement.

### 3.8 Case 8: Complex Multi-condition Combination Query (Relative Date, Location, Multi-value IN, Numerical Comparison)

1.  **Ordinary NL2SQL Input**: `I want to perform a comprehensive query on order data: Please find all orders created last year that also satisfy the following conditions: First, their shipping address must include Shanghai; second, the customer name for the order is either Wang Wu or Zhao Liu; third, the amount of these orders must be greater than 500 yuan. Please list all detailed information for orders that meet these criteria.` (116 "effort units")
2.  **Expected SQL Output** (assuming today is 2025-06-06):
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders
    WHERE order_creation_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2024-12-31 23:59:59'
      AND order_address LIKE '%Shanghai%'
      AND customer_name IN ('Wang Wu', 'Zhao Liu')
      AND order_amount > 500;
    ```
3.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Input**: `last year Shanghai Wang Wu Zhao Liu >500` (16 "effort units" based on original paper's logic for Chinese keywords. English: "last year" (8) + "Shanghai" (8) + "Wang Wu" (7) + "Zhao Liu" (8) + ">500" (4) + 4 spaces = 39 chars. We use the original 16 as an effort proxy. Efficiency improvement `(116-16)/16 * 100% = 625.00%`)
4.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Reasoning Process**:
    *   **Data Pattern Recognition**: Input includes relative date "last year", text "Shanghai", two names "Wang Wu", "Zhao Liu", and a numerical value with an operator ">500".
    *   **Field Back-inference**:
        *   "last year": Relative date. Could correspond to `Orders.order_creation_date`, `Products.product_launch_data`, `Customers.customer_registration_date`.
        *   "Shanghai": Place name fragment. Could correspond to `Orders.order_address`, `Customers.customer_address`.
        *   "Wang Wu", "Zhao Liu": Names. Could correspond to `Orders.customer_name`, `Customers.customer_name`.
        *   ">500": Numerical comparison. Could correspond to `Orders.order_amount`, `Products.product_price`.
    *   **Table Back-inference and Ambiguity Handling**:
        *   The table where all these data fragments can "coexist" most harmoniously is `Orders`.
            *   `Orders.order_creation_date` (matches "last year")
            *   `Orders.order_address` (matches "Shanghai", `LIKE '%Shanghai%'`)
            *   `Orders.customer_name` (matches "Wang Wu", "Zhao Liu", using `IN` operator)
            *   `Orders.order_amount` (matches ">500")
        *   The LLM will select this table, which can accommodate all data clues to the greatest extent, as the primary query table.
    *   **Operator and Logic Construction**:
        *   "last year": Based on "Today is June 6, 2025", "last year" refers to the entire year 2024, converted to `order_creation_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2024-12-31 23:59:59'`.
        *   "Wang Wu Zhao Liu": Two juxtaposed text items of the same type (names) imply `customer_name IN ('Wang Wu', 'Zhao Liu')`.
        *   All conditions are connected by `AND`.
    *   **SQL Generation**: The expected SQL is generated based on the most probable comprehensive inference.
5.  **Search-driven NL2SQL Advantages Analysis**:
    *   **Handles Complex Combination Queries**: Even for complex queries involving multiple types of conditions (time, location, multi-value, numerical), search-driven input maintains a high degree of conciseness.
    *   **Powerful Comprehensive Reasoning**: The LLM demonstrates a strong ability to integrate seemingly disparate data fragments and infer their specific meanings and logical relationships within a particular table context.
    *   **Matches User Mental Model**: When users conceive complex queries, they often think in terms of these key data points. Search-driven input aligns well with this mental model, allowing users to "think it, get it."

## 4. Comprehensive Data Comparison

To more comprehensively evaluate the query efficiency of Search-driven NL2SQL, we conducted comparative experiments on a professional evaluation dataset containing approximately 2000 queries. This dataset covers various types of query needs. Both approaches used GPT-4o as the LLM. We recorded the average input character count for ordinary NL2SQL and Search-driven NL2SQL across different query types and calculated the efficiency improvement percentage.

**Table 1: Comparison of Average Input Character Count and Efficiency Improvement for Two NL2SQL Approaches Across Different Query Types**

*Note: Input character counts for "Ordinary NL2SQL" are based on the original paper's metrics for Chinese input. The "Search-driven NL2SQL" counts are also based on the original paper's abstracted "effort units" for brevity, not necessarily literal English character counts for keywords. The percentage improvement is the key takeaway.*

### 4.1 Data Analysis
From Table 1, we can observe:
1.  **Universal Advantage**: Search-driven NL2SQL has a significantly lower average input character count than ordinary NL2SQL across all tested query types, leading to substantial query efficiency improvements.
2.  **Magnitude of Efficiency Improvement**: The average efficiency improvement reaches 502.87%. For simple queries (like exact value lookup, relative date queries), the improvement is particularly outstanding, reaching up to 735.32% (relative date queries). This is because such queries often require only a few characters or keywords in the search-driven input.
3.  **High Efficiency for Complex Queries**: Even for complex combination queries, search-driven input maintains high conciseness, with an efficiency improvement of 473.98%. This benefits from the LLM's strong combinatorial reasoning capabilities.
4.  **Improved User Experience**: The reduction in input characters directly translates to less time consumption and lower cognitive burden, greatly enhancing the user experience of interacting with databases.

This data robustly demonstrates the immense potential of Search-driven NL2SQL in improving query efficiency. Users no longer need to lengthily describe their query intent and related table structure information but can directly and concisely provide the "data" they care about, with the system intelligently completing the subsequent understanding and conversion tasks.

## 5. Advantages of Search-driven NL2SQL

*   **Ultimate Query Efficiency**: Drastic reduction in input characters, leading to faster interaction, especially suitable for mobile or voice input scenarios.
*   **Extremely Low Cognitive Load**: Users do not need to memorize table names or field names, only provide the core data values they are interested in.
*   **High Ease of Use**: Closer to natural search habits, low learning curve, extremely friendly to non-technical users.
*   **Powerful Flexibility**: Simple symbols (>, <, -, space, etc.) can express complex conditions and logic.
*   **Good Robustness**: Reduces NL understanding errors caused by users' improper phrasing or synonym choices.
*   **Supports Contextual Reasoning**: Can perform more intelligent inferences by incorporating current date, dialogue history (if introduced), etc.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work

### 6.1 Conclusion
The "Search-driven NL2SQL" paradigm proposed in this paper, by guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) to back-infer fields and tables based on user-input data values, significantly revolutionizes the interaction model of traditional NL2SQL. Comprehensive case analyses and experimental data based on GPT-4o both indicate that this method can substantially improve query efficiency (average improvement exceeding 500%) and reduce user cognitive load, making database querying more intuitive and convenient.

The core advantage of Search-driven NL2SQL lies in its "data-centric" query philosophy, which more closely aligns with users' natural thinking and search habits. Users no longer need to act as "SQL translation apprentices," guessing and learning the internal structure of the database, but can directly express the data clues they know.

### 6.2 Future Work
Looking ahead, research on Search-driven NL2SQL can be deepened in the following directions:

1.  **Hybrid Query Understanding**: Integrating the conciseness of search-driven input with the flexibility of traditional NL descriptions to allow users to mix data values and natural language instructions, addressing broader and more complex query scenarios.
2.  **Interactive Disambiguation and Learning**: Optimizing the presentation of user choice prompts to make them more intelligent and context-aware. Enabling the system to learn from user choices to progressively reduce ambiguity in future similar queries.
3.  **Multi-turn Dialogue and Contextual Memory**: Maintaining memory of confirmed data clues and user preferences in multi-turn dialogues to achieve more coherent and personalized data exploration experiences.
4.  **Integration with Knowledge Graphs**: Utilizing knowledge graphs to enhance understanding of data semantic relationships and business logic, improving the accuracy of field and table back-inference, especially in complex schemas and multi-table join scenarios.
5.  **Extension to More Complex Analytical Tasks**: Exploring how to extend the search-driven concept to more advanced data operations such as aggregation, grouping, sorting, and even simple predictive analytics.

In summary, Search-driven NL2SQL offers a highly promising new path for natural language interaction with databases. With the continuous evolution of Large Language Model capabilities, we have reason to believe that this user-centric, data-driven query method will play an increasingly important role in future data intelligence applications.
